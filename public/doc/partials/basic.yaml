    description: |
        The API uses two variants of authentication. An application can use basic authentication via HTTP for identification. As an alternative, there is a header with the name "X-Authkey". This key can be optained by accessing "/workstation/login/".

        According to the application settings, there might be different rights to use API methods. Further rights depend on the settings for the authorized useraccount.
